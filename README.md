# Nashville Housing Data Cleaning and Analysis  

## Project Overview  
This project involves cleaning and analyzing the **Nashville Housing** dataset using **SQL**. The dataset contains real estate property records, and the objective is to transform raw, messy data into a structured format suitable for analysis.  

## Key Objectives  
- Clean the dataset by handling missing values, standardizing formats, and removing duplicates.  
- Perform SQL-based transformations to enhance data consistency and usability.  
- Analyze trends in the Nashville housing market using SQL queries.  

## Technologies Used  
- **SQL (Structured Query Language)** – For data cleaning and analysis.  
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server** – MySQL Workbench 
- **Kaggle** – Source of the dataset.  

## Data Cleaning Process  
The following transformations were performed using SQL:  
- Standardized **date formats** for consistency.  
- Removed **duplicate records** to avoid redundancy.  
- Filled in **missing values** using appropriate techniques.  
- Split and formatted **address columns** for better usability.  
- Converted **text-based categorical values** into a structured format.  

## Data Analysis  
- Identified trends in **property prices** over time.  
- Analyzed **property types and their distribution** in Nashville.  
- Examined **sales patterns** across different zip codes.  
- Detected any **anomalies or outliers** in the dataset.  

## Dataset  
- The dataset was sourced from **Kaggle**.
